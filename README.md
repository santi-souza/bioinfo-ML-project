# Bioactivity Prediction Project

This repository contains a bioinformatics project focused on predicting the biological activity of compounds against the target protein Acetylcholinesterase. 
The project follows the tutorial series by Data Professor, which guides through the process of data collection, exploratory data analysis, molecular descriptor calculation, and regression model building.

This project is divided into multiple parts, each addressing a different stage of the bioinformatics pipeline:
1. Data Collection: Downloaded and pre-processed biological activity data from the ChEMBL database.
2. Lipinski Descriptors & EDA: Calculated molecular descriptors and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Target Protein Selection & Dataset Preparation: Focused on Acetylcholinesterase due to its larger dataset and prepared data for modeling.
4. Regression Model Building: Built a regression model to predict pIC50 values.
5. Model Comparison: Used the LazyPredict library to compare various regression models.
